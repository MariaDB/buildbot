class BaseBuilder:

    BaseBuilder is a class responsible for managing build sequences and generating
    build configurations for a Buildbot builder. It provides methods to add build
    sequences, process build steps, and generate a factory and configuration for
    the builder.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the builder.
        build_sequences (list[BuildSequence]): A list of build sequences associated
            with the builder.

    Methods:
        __init__(name: str):
            Initializes the BaseBuilder instance with a name and an empty list of
            build sequences.

        add_sequence(sequence: BuildSequence):
            Adds a build sequence to the builder.

        get_factory() -> BuildFactory:
            Generates and returns a BuildFactory instance containing the processed
            build steps.

        get_config(
            can_start_build: Callable[[Builder, AbstractWorkerForBuilder, BuildRequest], bool],
            Generates and returns a BuilderConfig object for the builder, including
            worker names, tags, build properties, and factory steps.

            workers (Iterable[WorkerBase]): An iterable of WorkerBase instances
                representing the workers assigned to this builder.
            can_start_build (Callable): A callable that determines if a build can

            next_build (Callable): A callable that determines the next build request.

        Mention on the jobs parameter:
            - jobs is a measure of how many CPU's are used for the build, for commands that support parallel execution (e.g. make, mtr).
            - provide a value greater or equal to 1
            - jobs should never exceed the number of CPU's available on the worker, given by the worker total_jobs property.
            - canStartBuild will determine at runtime if the builder can start on any of the workers assigned to it, based on what other jobs were claimed (currently running) by other builders.

            util.BuilderConfig: A BuilderConfig object containing the builder's configuration.
