class WorkerPool:
    """
    A class to manage a pool of workers categorized by architecture.

    Attributes:
        workers (defaultdict): A dictionary where keys are architecture types (str)
            and values are lists of worker names (str) associated with that architecture.
        instances (list): A list of worker instances.

    Methods:
        __init__():
            Initializes the WorkerPool with empty workers and instances.

        add(arch: str, worker):
            Adds a worker to the pool under the specified architecture.
            Args:
                arch (str): The architecture type to associate the worker with.
                worker (object): The worker object, which must have `name` and `instance` attributes.

        get_workers_for_arch(arch: str, filter_fn: callable = None) -> list:
            Retrieves a list of worker names for the specified architecture, optionally filtered
            by a provided function.
            Args:
                arch (str): The architecture type to retrieve workers for.
                filter_fn (callable, optional): A function to filter the workers. Defaults to None.
            Returns:
                list: A list of worker names matching the specified architecture and filter criteria.
            Raises:
                ValueError: If no workers are found for the specified architecture.

        config (dict[str, dict]): Configuration dictionary containing worker-specific settings.
        total_jobs (int): Total number of jobs assigned to the worker.
        max_builds (int, optional): Maximum number of builds the worker can handle concurrently. Defaults to 999 because the builder-to-worker allocation is handled by canStartBuild() based on how many jobs a builder is requesting.
